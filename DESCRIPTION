Description:  perform alignment between current COVID strands and one or more 
  user-provided genome sequence samples of COVID virus and identify the strand 
  each sample belongs to with a graphical visualization of the mutation site in
  the sequence. I would like to improve it so that this package can analyze 
  multiple sequence samples and propose the possible relation between samples 
  to construct an epidemiological transmission link if exits.
